# Text_Vectorization_and_Preprocessing_for_NLP
This project explores text vectorization using CountVectorizer and TfidfVectorizer with Python. It includes tokenization, n-grams, stopword removal, and custom preprocessing like lemmatization and stemming. Multiple approaches are demonstrated, such as default settings, n-gram configurations, stopword filtering, and custom preprocessing functions. The project concludes with vectorization using the TF-IDF method, capturing term importance while reducing dimensionality. These techniques are fundamental for Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, transforming raw text into numerical features suitable for machine learning models. Ideal for beginners, the project emphasizes flexibility and optimization in feature extraction from textual data.
