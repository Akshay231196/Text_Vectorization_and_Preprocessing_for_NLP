# Text_Vectorization_and_Preprocessing_for_NLP
This project explores text vectorization techniques, including CountVectorizer and TF-IDF, with custom preprocessing (stopwords removal, stemming, and lemmatization). It uses n-grams to capture word sequences and demonstrates transforming text into numerical representations for NLP tasks.
